# FTGU: <i>From The Ground Up!</i>
FTGU is a Minecraft 1.16.5 mod for Forge. It aims to to make <b>technology</b> and <b>construction</b> more accurate to real-life by fundamentally changing their traditional representation in modded Minecraft.

### Technology
<ul>
No more one-block machines - everything is <b>modular</b>, constructed from a central multiblock - the <b>Chamber</b> - and numerous external actors. </p>
No more magic filtering - fluids and items can go anywhere in your factory. It's up to you to organize them! </p>
</ul>

### Construction
<ul>
No more carrying blocks in your inventory - everything will be <b>assembled</b> in-world with items, tools, and movable large ingredients. </p>
No more floating blocks - FTGU, as its name implies, makes sure your buildings are structurally sound. </p>
</ul>
And numerous other changes that I don't want to promise because I might change my mind!
